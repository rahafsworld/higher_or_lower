This is a simple command-line game where you compare the follower counts of two Instagram accounts and guess which one has more followers, which continues until you make an incorrect guess.

How to play:
1. The game starts by selecting two random Instagram accounts from a predefined dataset.
2. You will be shown the name, description, and country of two accounts labeled as "A" and "B".
3. Type 'A' or 'B' to guess which account has more followers.
4. If your guess is correct, your score increases and the game continues with a new comparison. If your guess is incorrect, the game ends and your final score is displayed.
